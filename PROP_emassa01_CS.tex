\begin{abstract}
The current proposal presents my objective to research and build a user model within Search, to address the downfalls of current Search tools for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The user model will be built around the core features of ASD. The model will be applied to results returned from a synthesis of three leading existing search engines. The final product will be integrated with motion controllers, with the aim to enhance the user experience and the interface of Search for people with ASD. These findings will provide novel insights into the needs and wants of individuals with ASD within search, and enable future development and interventions within these information streams and communication channels.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Statement} \label{prob}
Most search engines apply a general user model to refine search queries. These models are designed to work with the general population, e.g., the auto-complete, query understanding, site and page quality signals, user content and synonym snippets are all geared towards working with the typical user. Very little research to date has attempted to define a user model within search for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It is currently unknown whether current user models need to be adjusted for this subgroup. Although people with ASD are relatively proficient with technologies, we argue that the user models that underlie the way in which search queries are handled and the needs of the user differ to the mainstream models. This project aims to build a suitable user model of ASD to address this issue.
As it has been shown that individuals with ASD are more engaged (sand how sustained attention) when using technology that is receptive (games, responsive consoles, motion controlled devices) and interactive compared to technology that is not, this project will combine interactive, Motion Recognition hardware with Search to improve the User Interface and architecture of Search for individuals with ASD.

\subsection{The Role of Context In Search}
It is unlikely that any given page on the web will contain a word or phrase that means exactly (or nearly) the same as another word or phrase in that language (e.g., shut and close). How is it then that your search engine of choice picks these phrases to mean the same thing, and returns them synonymously in the results of your query? Well, quite simply put, it is by virtue of the fact that each of their neighbouring words and associations are similar. These are indirect, higher-order associations, and provide the context in which the search engine can index keywords. This context plays a crucial role in search; first, in the interpretation of the user query, and second, the context is reflected in the results returned to the user.

\subsection{What is ASD?}
The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is amongst the most common neurodevelopmental condition and it is currently estimated that 1/68 children meet criteria for ASD (CDC, 2014). ASD is five times more common amongst boys than girls (1/42 boys, and 1/189 girls). According to the DSM-V (2013) diagnostic manual, ASD is characterized by persistent and early deficits in reciprocal social interaction and repetitive behaviours. Individuals vary from high functioning to low functioning (along a spectrum), with behaviours emerging around 2 to 3 years of age.

\subsection{The Problem: Current Search Tools for people with ASD}\label{the problem}
Search engines assume that the user is context-driven, and attempt to model the user's intent using higher-order contextual information gathered from available web pages. This process also models the human brain's ability to extract context and semantic associations from information. However, people with ASD are less context-sensitive, preferring a more detail-focused processing style \cite{mottron}. They would intuitively form search queries very differently. Individuals with ASD are also less likely to engage in a relational (hierarchically organized) style of processing \cite{bowler} suggesting that relating information in a hierarchically organised framework is less likely. Hierarchical organisation implies a great deal of flexibility and mental-shifting, as a simple example, in a search for 'apple', it would imply awareness that the word is related to 'pear' but also to 'fruit'. Awareness of this latter relation also suggests awareness that 'apple' is related to 'pomegranate'. Of course, in genuine search queries these associations can get very complex very quickly. Generally speaking, individuals with ASD prefer, and are more likely to engage in an item-specific processing style, and, whilst intelligent cognition is definitely possible, search queries are more likely formed of first-order associations\footnote{Of course there is a great deal of individual variability in Autism Spectrum Disorder.}. \\
\\Several Psychology learning and intervention studies for individuals with high functioning ASD have suggested that assimilation and accommodation of new information is most appropriate when:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Information is concrete (i.e, not abstract).
\item Information is presented in small manageable chunks.
\item Information is not verbally "overloaded" (not too many words).
\item Information is presented in the expected way and does not deviate from this.
\end{enumerate}
Several interventions have been built around this body of literature (www.autismspeaks.org).
Given these findings from the literature we can make several adjustments to current Search tools to enhance their benefit for people with ASD. For example, a user with ASD would have improved user-experience if their search results:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Were first assessed (before presentation to the user) for the Key Word In a suitable context.
\item Followed a similar order of semantic association, in line with the search query itself (preference for first-order relations). 
\item Had smaller snippets and presented in a more manageable way (less overloaded with words).
\item Were visually consistent.
\item Had a high degree of verbal consistency/similarity with the search query.
\end{enumerate}

\section{What should Search offer people with ASD?}\label{What should Search offer people with ASD}
\subsection{Search and Learning}
The Internet is one of the largest resources of information, and can be searched by users from different areas of the world relatively quickly. Search engines allow users to collate hundreds of links on a single topic, using only a few words or phrases. The information returned is vast, and the depth of users’ searches can be determined by more advanced refinement options \footnote{For example, using the keyword NOT, or, by applying precedence to a selection of search query terms likely to be returned. This implies the user can flexiblly shift perspective to guess the keywords likely to be picked up and returned by the search engine. Assuming the user has this knowledge they may choose to do a targeted search for just some specific key term.}. Search is an therefore an important learning tool; its significance is duly noted because of the learning benefits it brings for children and adolescents as they begin to navigate the Internet and gain an understanding of several subjects. 

\subsection{Clues from virtual reality and gaming}
Almost all teenagers (97\% of those aged 12-17) use a computer, web, portable or console devices, 73\% of which is desktop or laptop based. Teenagers with ASD also use technology and spend a substantial amount of their time using devices \cite{Shane and Albert}. They are proficient, and use these devices with relative ease, showing high levels of engagement with consoles like the Xbox (Kinect) or Wii, Portable Gaming Devices (Nintendo DS), or cell phone or handheld device. For individuals with ASD, computer-based technologies can provide a stable, consistent learning environment that can be customized \cite{moore}. With this in mind, the proposed system will utilize motion controllers to facilitate user attention and engagement with Search. 

\subsection{Motion Controllers}
Motion recognition devices can be programmed to make consistent responses to environmental triggers. This is unlike real-world situations where environmental responses are not always consistent and may require further interpretation or ‘guess-work’. These controlled and interactive environments have shown promise for improving social communication skills and reducing repetitive behaviours \cite{gameshealth}.

\subsection{Visual not text-based}
People with ASD demonstrate stronger visal memory \cite{fabienne} than verbal memory, so a more visually-oriented approach to search (one that doesn’t require sustaining a verbal search query in working memory) is a more appropriate way to present data to bolster the strength of visual memory in ASD.


\section {Creating a User Model of ASD}\label{usermodel}
\subsection{What is a user model?}
A user model is a collection of information associated with a particular user, with which a system can adapt its behavior in order to customize in line with the user’s needs. The concept of user modeling has strong implications for the way in which humans and computers interact; by creating a representation of the user, the system can be better informed about how to behave in various circumstances, for example, the system can acknowledge a specific kind of user’s needs, preferences, likes, dislikes, goals, plans, knowledge, and skill. The system can maintain this knowledge whilst interacting and adapting its behavior with the user.
Persona development will support the user modeling process by identifying particular characteristics of individuals with ASD in Search. An individual’s personal information pertaining to the persona, will be stored in a user profile which will contain information such as age, gender, lifestyle, frequent tasks, tools used, resources commonly used and crucially for this project, the profile will include information about diagnosis (Autism, Asperger, and high/low functioning).

\subsection{Types of user models}
User models can be static, and unchanging (i.e., no algorithms are used in order to teach the model about the changing preferences of the user, and no new information is fed into the model), or dynamic (representation of the user with their up-to-date changes in interests, and recent interactions with the system). Alternatively, user models can be stereotyped. This means they utilize demographic information to classify users into distinct subtypes. The system infers or assumes other characteristics about this subset of users by making use of data gathered from other users also included within this subset. Lastly a user model can be highly adaptive and try to model the one user on their own, without stereotyping or inferring the characteristics of the user. This type of user modeling requires a large amount of data collection prior to its implementation.
\\The model can gather information through direct interaction with its user (e.g., via a registration process), by observing and interpreting the users actions, or, by a combination of both, that is, the system may ask for feedback, and alter its approach depending on the user’s behavior.
The type of user model used for this system will be decided upon after testing and obtaining user feedback.

\subsection{Benefits and difficulties of user modeling in Search}
A user model needs to collect data before it can predict the user’s needs with accuracy, but once this is achieved, information can be presented according to the user’s knowledge, ability and goals. It can also effectively filter out irrelevant information and rank the remaining search results in the most relevant way according for the user.
Creating a user model is not an easy task. The designer of the system has to set weights of parameters for the information that is fed into the model, and decide what course of action to take when two pieces of information may conflict. Some of the difficulties associated with deciding the priorities of elements of the model will be decided with user-feedback. Other elements of the user model will be based on modeling well-researched cognitive processes in ASD (for example, a user model that focuses on first-order, or, item-specific relations to form a search query, rather than hierarchical relations to form a search query).  

\subsection{Adaptive / Personalised Search}
Adaptive or Personalised search, is one way in which search engines including Google, Yahoo and Bing have attempted to tailor the search results for their users. The feature was first introduced as part of a GoogleLabs project in 2004 and implemented in 2005. It associates each user search with a HTTP cookie – this is a piece of data (a text file) sent from the website and saved in the users’ browser when the user navigates that website. These cookies contain information such as login information (gender, age), preferences (languages, interests) and other information about previous searches based on site traffic. The cookies allow the website to ‘remember’ stateful information about what buttons the user clicked on, or what sites they visited. This cookie record allows the search engine to return results that are highly relevant to the search query, but also highly relevant to the pages that the user visited through previous searches. When personalised or adaptive search is combined with GPS data from a smartphone or device, it can provide useful information about the places that user has previously visited to higher rank local items in the users returned results. This creates a personalized or adaptive web search, as the feature allows the web search to be tailored to the user’s preferences over the course of time, and as more searches are recorded.

\subsection{Disadvantages of adaptive search for individuals with ASD}
Although adaptive search seems to have significant user benefit in terms of relevance to the user for that search query, it decreases the likelihood that the user encounters new information and biases the results towards the users location and their previous site traffic.  This has the unwanted effect of creating a filter bubble (Pariser, 2011), which is argued to close us off from important and relevant information and create a personal ecosystem of information for one particular user, creating the impression that “our narrow self interest is all that exists”. The filter bubble also has potential privacy problems, as the user may be unaware that the search has been specifically tailored towards their interests and they wonder why things that they have previously searched for have become more and more relevant. The filter bubble may positively reinforce restricted interests in ASD as the user constantly receives feedback about their previous (idiosyncratic and personalized) searches without being able to break out of that repetitive loop. 
Recent research has suggested personalization also increases ‘background noise’ relative to the search results \cite{briggs}. Briggs (2014) suggests that there is a carry-over effect in personalized search for the users, whereby prior search results influence the results of subsequent searches \footnote{It should be noted that personalization of search results generally takes a lower priority for the ranking algorithms than the URLs ranked top in terms of their relevance for the search query.}.  Nevertheless this carry-over may be disadvantageous for people with ASD as it muddies their search space.
In order to produce a search tool specifically tailored to reduce the filter bubble effect in ASD, widen the information gateway and reduce the possibility for restricted and repetitive searches, the weighting on previous search results needs to be reduced. This would be particularly important for individuals with restricted interests. For these users, it would limit the possibility that they get trapped in a spiraling loop of ever-narrowing user-relevant information and over personalization of self-reinforced information ecosystems.

\subsection{Where will the User Information be Stored?}
TODO\\
Integrating the user settings into existing systems, e.g., save the settings inside Google Accounts, Google Plus or a Google Hangout.

\section{Existing Combination/Advanced Search Engines}\label{Existing Combination/Advanced Search Engines}
\subsection{Bing vs Google}
Bing vs. Google presents the users’ search query results from both search engines to allow the user to make a comparison (the Google and Bing results can be presented vertically or horizontally beside each other), and provides the experience of navigating both search pages simultaneously.  
The number of other personal preferences options is very limited (the orientation of the results is just about all the user has the option to choose). There is also double the information on the page, so not suitable for the current project.

\subsection{Qrobe.it}
Qrobe combines three search engines’ results (Google, Bing and Ask) and presents them conveniently on one page. Unlike Bing vs Google the user can search ‘web’, ‘images’ or ‘popular’ (to reveal stories from Reddit). Qrobe.it also has a ‘cheatsheet’ that allows user to search using shortcuts, which may prove useful to a seasoned Qrobe user. Qrobe unfortunately has no API for developers to use to extend its functionality further.

\subsection{AskBoth}
AskBoth – is a work in progress, and combines both Google and Bing, with a section in the middle dedicated to twitter. AskBoth argues that the selling points for the site are it’s ‘uncomplicatedness’, aesthetics and user experience – which promises to be particularly good (that is, has promised, since 2009!).

\subsection{Spectra}
Spectra takes searching from Google, Bing and Yahoo engines one-small-step-further. This site allows users to assign weights and determine the way results are displayed. Spectra gathers the search results, ranks them and displays them according to their algorithm. Spectra does not provide an API for developers, and the rigor of the search is hard to test.

\subsection{Conclusions and ways forward}
These search engines allow users to see more results than what one search engine alone would present, they often do this with a cost -- redundancy. The benefits are that there is more information presented to the users at once but often at a cost of ‘cognitive overload’ and/ or near –duplicates. This is not ideal for users with ASD, as this is precisely the opposite of what the systems aims and objectives were see Section~\ref{prob}.
To date, a user model for ASD within Search has not been built. The following section presents the proposed system that will try and address this issue.


\section{Proposed Search Page and Controller Web Application}\label{proposed}

Insert Image Here!!!!\\This project will produce a search engine designed to enhance the user experience within search for people with ASD. Below I list the core and non-core features to include:


\subsection{Core Features and Development Milestones}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A synthesis of the results from three of the largest and most popular search engines (Google, 67.5\%, Microsoft Bing 18.4\% and Yahoo 10.3\%) \cite{adam}

\item The design and implementation of a user model to apply to these results to filter them according to specific user needs. The model will return concrete, managable (not text-overloaded) results, in a consistent mannar. The search engine will perform a Key Word In Context search and prioritise results where the key words are used direcly, or results have first-order semantic relations to the query words (see Section~\ref{the problem}).

\item Using motion controllers to enhance embodiment within search, and enhance the search query process. One idea is to have users be able to physically 'grab' results, to save them to inspect later. This will mean they do not have to 'track' or remember their navigation around search, but rather, filter their own results at an earlier time point. I will investigate the use of the LEAP motion controller as the main device in the first instance.

\item Get user feedback by testing the web search with the LEAP motion controller, with a group of individuals diagnosed with ASD.

\item Revise the model and the ideas to choose the best possible approach/tools to tackle search (experience) optimization for people with ASD.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-core Features}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Investigating the user preferences when a page with a higher number of pictures ranks higher than those with many words. 

\item An investigation of other motion controller devices, possibly the Oculus VR Rift, Xbox Kinnect.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation of the System}\label{api}
\subsection{Selection of Search Engines}
The three most popular search engines (as calculated using an average of the unique monthly visitors) are Google (1,100,000,000 estimated monthly visitors), Bing (350.000.000 estimated monthly visitors) and Yahoo! (300,000,000 estimated monthly visitors)\cite{ebiz}. Google is the most recent and goliath question-answering system (query volume = 64.5\%)\cite{adam}, and the word has become synonymous with the word ‘search’ on the web.This search engine is often considered the most innovative and dynamic, and is the most popular amongst users worldwide (using global traffic rank figures, in March 2015). Yahoo (2003) was the first ever web directory service; it has stronger advertising and e-commerce partnerships and has a query volume of 19.8\%. Bing (Microsoft’s answer to search, previously known as msn search), was officially launched in 2005, and has a query volume of 12.8\%, which is substantially less than Google, but nevertheless, is within the top 3 search engines.Other search engines include Ask, AOL, WOW, which will not be included in the search system proposed here in order to limit the redundancy of the search results (of which there will already be a fair amount, see Section~\ref{Existing Combination/Advanced Search Engines}). 

\subsection{APIs, Text-Search Libraries}
I will be using API’s to work with the three search engines outlined in the above section. Although the same information could be gathered by inspecting the source code for the pages that return the search query results, the API’s were considered to be far more efficient in doing so (e.g., Apache Lucene Key Word In Context is optimised for maximum search efficiency see Section~\ref{apache}). 

\subsubsection{Google Custom Search}
Google Custom Search (GCS) rpovides an API to create a personalised search engine that can be configured to search web pages and images. It works on a pay per search principle. Once signed up, the GCS requires a consumer key and secret, which are hardcoded in the development of the search.\\
The API has methods which allow the user to …TODO\\
However, this API needs to be used in conjunction with a textual-search library in order to reach the Goals of this project (the API does not offer Key Word In Context Search in order to trace the contextual information being returned to the user). Costs \$0.01/search.

\subsubsection{Yahoo BOSS}
Just like Google Custom Search, the Yahoo BOSS API required the creation of a search engine project (pay per search) with a consumer key and secret. The API is also easy to use and offers the same functionality as the CSC but again is not sufficient alone to reach the goals of the project. Costs \$0.01/search.

\subsubsection{Bing Search API (Data)}
The Bing Search API, similar to Yahoo BOSS and GCS will produce results for Web, Images, News, Videos, Related Search. Bing Search API also includes spelling suggestions based on the query entered. Costs \$0.00/search (max 5000 searches/month)

\subsubsection{Faroo API}
Is a free alternative API to Google Custom Search API (business), Yahoo BOSS API  (commercial) and Bing Web Search Enterprise (commercial). It offers the possibility to do a Web Search with more that 2 billion pages indexed. Faroo can return news search (articles from newspapers, magazines and blogs) and sort results by publishing date, with author and article image. Trending news pages are also indexed and can be grouped by topic. The API includes suggestions with auto-completes for misspelled items in the search query \cite{faroo}.

\subsubsection{Apache Lucene Library}\label{apache}

\subsubsection{Google+ API}
I mention before that ... Persona development will support the user modeling process by identifying particular characteristics of individuals with ASD in Search. An individual’s personal information pertaining to the persona, will be stored in a user profile which will contain information such as age, gender, lifestyle, frequent tasks, tools used, resources commonly used and crucially for this project, the profile will include information about diagnosis (Autism, Asperger, and high/low functioning).

\subsubsection{Libraries for Hardware (Motion Controllers)}
\subsubsection{Visual aesthetics: threeJs library (Non-Core Features)}
\subsubsection{Development Languages}

\section{Integrating the System with Motion Controller Hardware }\label{hardware}
\subsection{Current Project’s Hardware Selection Process}
Humans have many senses that go beyond the computer's screen. The usability of the hardware will this be determined as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Good timing of the device correlates to a good meaning and a good User Experience. The LEAP has options to ‘poll’ frames at a constant rate (to keep timing of movement accurate).
\item Cognitive ‘lag’ time. Each of our senses operates with a different lag time. Hearing has the fastest sense-to-cognition/understanding time, and surprisingly sight is the slowest. The device should therefore work with the combinatorial configuration of the senses.
\item As this is a tool to be used with individuals with ASD, the sensory experience of the device cannot be overwhelming.
\item Cognitive load should not be high (the device is being used to assist with search, so operating the device should not require a great deal of cognitive effort).
\item The device should integrate with concrete behaviours, e.g., drop or grab. 

\end{enumerate}

\section{Directions and Implications}\label{future}
As we move towards personalized information retrieval, we hope to move towards state of the art information access and retrieval. The future of Search will promise the return of personalized results, which are adapted to the users specific needs. This project deals with only one subset of the population, but the same can be achieved of any group of users. Search engines can deal with the information overload problem (i.e., multi-media, text information), by exploiting these user models to turn the masses of information available into a specific set of “information goods” for any one user, providing good quality personalized information for users.
